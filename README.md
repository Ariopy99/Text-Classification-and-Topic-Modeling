# PubMed Text Classification and Topic Modeling

## üìö Project Overview

In this project, the analysis of a textual dataset is addressed using **text mining techniques**.  
The main objective is to:

- **Preprocess** the textual data (cleaning, tokenization, removal of irrelevant elements)
- **Classify** the content into predefined categories using machine learning algorithms
- **Extract** the main themes through **topic modeling** techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

This approach enables the transformation of unstructured text into structured, meaningful information.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available at the following link:  
üîó [PubMed 200k RCT dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthewjansen/pubmed-200k-rtc)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: For computational reasons, we selected only the training set and randomly sampled **20,000 observations** from it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods and Tools

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization
- **Text Classification**: Supervised machine learning models (e.g. logistic regression, SVM)
- **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract dominant themes
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and visualization of topic distributions

## üß† Objectives

The final goal is to provide a **structured representation** of biomedical research abstracts by:
- Automatically labeling them into categories
- Discovering the latent topics present in the corpus

## üß™ Reproducibility

All code and analysis steps are included in this repository to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
